# Codes for Manuscript
Code for generating figures and tables from "Normalization and De-noising of Single-cell Hi-C Data with BandNorm and scVI-3D"

Data can be downloaded from https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~sshen82/bandnorm/, which contains 5 dataset: Kim2020, Lee2019, Li2019, Ramani2017 and Tan2021. The resolution of the datasets are all 1mb, and the format of them is suitable for BandNorm. Meta data for all datasets are also available in the Summary folder.

In this repository, there are three folders. runAlgorithms folder consists of all codes that run algorithms to do clustering and lower-dimension reduction for scHi-C data. FigureGeneration includes all codes for generating figures in the article. OtherCodes includes codes performing other analyses such as calculating insulation.
